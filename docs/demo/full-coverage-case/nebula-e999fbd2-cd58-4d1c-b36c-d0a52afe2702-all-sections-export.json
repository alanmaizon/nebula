The Eastside Family Bridge Program addresses a critical need for eviction prevention and family support in East Portland and Gresham. According to the 2026 Impact Report, 57% of enrolled households were at risk of eviction within 60 days at intake, highlighting the urgency of the situation .\n2. The program serves a vulnerable population, with 74% of households including at least one child under age 18 and 49% reporting limited English proficiency, which complicates access to resources and services .\n3. Transportation barriers are a significant issue, with 41% of participants missing at least one appointment due to these challenges, underscoring the need for targeted support .\n\n### Citations\n- `org_impact_report_2026.txt` p1: Eastside Family Bridge Program Impact Report - 2026 Organization profile: - 501(c)(3) nonprofit providing housing stabilization and family support across East Portland and Gresham. - Completed full program cycles in 2024-2025 and 2025-20...\n\n## Program Design\n\n1. The Eastside Family Bridge Program is designed to address the urgent need for eviction prevention and family support in Multnomah County, Oregon. The program's core activities include weekly case management, monthly legal aid clinic referrals, and transportation assistance to ensure participants can access necessary services. This model has been successfully implemented in the 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 program cycles, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing housing for at-risk families .\n2. The staffing model for the program includes a Program Manager (0.40 FTE) and two Case Coordinators (0.50 FTE each), ensuring adequate support and supervision for direct service delivery. Additionally, the program allocates resources for transportation assistance vouchers, legal aid clinic contracts, and family stabilization supplies to address specific barriers faced by participants .\n3. The implementation timeline for the program is set for the period from July 1, 2027, to June 30, 2028. The program aims to achieve primary outcomes such as a 75% housing stability rate at 180 days, a 52% increase in monthly income or completion of new benefits enrollment, and a 72% appointment adherence rate. These outcomes will be measured through case management system records, benefits verification logs, and appointment attendance logs .\n\n### Citations\n- `org_impact_report_2026.txt` p1: Eastside Family Bridge Program Impact Report - 2026 Organization profile: - 501(c)(3) nonprofit providing housing stabilization and family support across East Portland and Gresham. - Completed full program cycles in 2024-2025 and 2025-20...\n- `project_budget_attachment_a.txt` p1: Attachment A: Project Budget Project period: July 1, 2027 - June 30, 2028 Requested amount: $80,000 Budget line items: - Program Manager (0.40 FTE): $26,400 - Two Case Coordinators (0.50 FTE each): $31,000 - Transportation assistance vou...\n- `evaluation_framework_appendix_c.txt` p1: Evaluation Framework Appendix C Primary outcomes and targets for the 2027-2028 grant period: - Housing Stability Rate: target 75% of enrolled households remain stably housed at 180 days. - Income or Benefits Gain: target 52% of enrolled ...\n\n## Outcomes and Evaluation\n\n1. The primary outcomes for the 2027-2028 grant period include a housing stability rate of 75% of enrolled households remaining stably housed at 180 days, an income or benefits gain target of 52% of enrolled households increasing monthly income or completing a new benefits enrollment, and an appointment adherence target of 72% of participants attending at least 80% of scheduled appointments (doc_id: evaluation_framework_appendix_c.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Evaluation Framework Appendix C Primary outcomes and targets for the 2027-2028 grant period...').\n2. Data sources for measuring these outcomes include case management system records, benefits verification logs, employment follow-up forms, and appointment attendance logs from partner clinics and schools (doc_id: evaluation_framework_appendix_c.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Data sources: - Case management system records (housing status, service contacts, referrals). - Benefits verification logs and employment follow-up forms. - Appointment attendance logs from partner clinics and schools.').\n3. The measurement cadence involves baseline assessments at intake, follow-up checks at day 90 and 180, and monthly QA audits reviewing a 10% sample of case files for data quality and service fidelity (doc_id: evaluation_framework_appendix_c.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Measurement cadence: - Baseline at intake. - Follow-up at day 90 and...').\n\n### Citations\n- `rfp_county_family_stability_2027.txt` p1: Funding Opportunity: Multnomah County Family Stability Grant 2027 Funder: Multnomah County Department of Human Services Deadline: April 30, 2027 at 4:00 PM Pacific Eligibility: - Applicants must be nonprofit organizations with active 501..."
