# Draft Application

## Need Statement

1. In Dublin, young adults aged 16-24 face significant employment barriers, particularly in underserved neighborhoods.

Additionally, 72% of those placed retained employment for at least 6 months, indicating a high dropout risk during the initial 45 days of placement .
2. The identified barriers to employment include limited transportation access for evening shifts and low digital literacy among first-time job seekers. These challenges are critical in ensuring that youth can secure and maintain employment .

## Outcomes and Evaluation

1. The BrightSteps Community Network has demonstrated significant outcomes in its youth employment program. In 2024, the organization served 1,482 youth across three districts, with 68% completing job-readiness training and 54% securing paid internships within 90 days . Furthermore, 72% of those placed into internships retained their employment for at least six months, highlighting the program's effectiveness in fostering long-term job stability .
2. Despite these achievements, the program faces challenges such as limited transportation access for evening shifts, low digital literacy among first-time job seekers, and a high dropout risk during the first 45 days of placement . To address these barriers, BrightSteps leverages its existing assets, including 24 employer partners, a mobile coaching team with bilingual staff, and a case management system with monthly progress tracking .
3. Looking ahead, BrightSteps aims to serve 1,700 youth by 2026, building on its current success and addressing identified barriers to enhance program outcomes . The organization's commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation is evident in its planned targets and strategic use of assets.
