According to the 2024 Impact Snapshot from BrightSteps Community Network, 68% of youth completed job-readiness training, yet only 54% were placed into paid internships within 90 days, highlighting a gap in employment opportunities and support systems for this demographic.\n2. Additionally, identified barriers such as limited transportation access for evening shifts and low digital literacy among first-time job seekers exacerbate the challenges faced by these youth. These barriers contribute to a high dropout risk during the first 45 days of placement, as noted in the 2024 Impact Snapshot.\n\n### Citations\n- `rfp.txt` p1: Funding Opportunity: City of Dublin Youth Workforce Innovation Grant 2026 Program Overview The City invites nonprofit proposals to expand paid career pathways for youth ages 16-24 in underserved neighborhoods. Total fund available: EUR 1...\n\n## Program Design\n\n1. Participant recruitment will leverage existing partnerships with local schools, community centers, and social services to identify and engage youth facing employment barriers. Outreach efforts will include targeted workshops and informational sessions to raise awareness about the program and its benefits. These sessions will be held in accessible locations and times to accommodate the schedules of potential participants. (doc_id: evidence.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Organization: BrightSteps Community Network 2024 Impact Snapshot - 1,482 youth served across three districts.')\n2. Employer partnerships will be expanded to include additional businesses in retail, logistics, and healthcare sectors, building on the existing network of 24 employer partners. These partnerships will be cultivated through regular meetings and presentations highlighting the benefits of hiring youth from underserved communities. Employers will be provided with tailored onboarding and support to facilitate successful placements and retention of participants. (doc_id: evidence.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Existing Program Assets - 24 employer partners in retail, logistics, and healthcare support.')\n3. The monthly service model will include ongoing job-readiness training, digital literacy workshops, and transportation support to address identified barriers such as limited access to evening shifts and low digital literacy. Participants will receive bi-weekly check-ins from a mobile coaching team to provide encouragement and address any challenges they may face. Additionally, a case management system will be utilized to track monthly progress and ensure participants remain engaged and supported throughout their placement. (doc_id: evidence.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Identified Barriers - Limited transportation access for evening shifts. - Low digital literacy among first-time job seekers.')\n\n### Citations\n- `rfp_community_resilience_2026.txt` p1: (30 points) - Outcomes and evidence quality (25 points) - Budget reasonableness (15 points) Disallowed costs: - Purchase of real estate - Political campaign activity - Expenses unrelated to direct program delivery\n\n## Outcomes and Evaluation\n\n1. The primary outcomes of the proposed youth program will be measured through participant surveys and case management records, focusing on improvements in housing stability, access to food resources, and overall well-being. These outcomes align with the City of Portland's emphasis on community resilience and the specific needs identified in the RFP. The evaluation will be conducted in three phases: baseline assessment at enrollment, mid-program assessment at six months, and final evaluation at the end of the program period.\n2. The evaluation strategy will incorporate both quantitative and qualitative methods to capture the full impact of the program. Quantitative data will include metrics such as the number of households remaining stably housed, the percentage of participants accessing food resources, and the reduction in reported transportation barriers. Qualitative data will be gathered through participant interviews and focus groups to provide deeper insights into the program's effectiveness and areas for improvement.\n\n### Citations\n- `rfp_community_resilience_2026.txt` p1: Funding Opportunity: City of Portland Community Resilience Microgrant 2026 Funder: City of Portland Office of Community Partnerships Deadline: March 15, 2026 at 5:00 PM Pacific Eligibility: - Applicants must be nonprofit organizations wi...\n\n## Sustainability\n\n_No draft paragraphs available._\n\n### Citations\n- None"
