According to the 2024 Impact Snapshot from BrightSteps Community Network, 68% of youth completed job-readiness training, yet only 54% were placed into paid internships within 90 days, highlighting a gap between training and employment . Additionally, 72% of those placed retained employment for at least 6 months, indicating a high dropout risk during the initial 45 days of placement .\n2. The identified barriers to employment include limited transportation access for evening shifts and low digital literacy among first-time job seekers. These challenges are critical in ensuring that youth can secure and maintain employment .\n\n### Citations\n- `evidence.txt` p1: Organization: BrightSteps Community Network 2024 Impact Snapshot - 1,482 youth served across three districts. - 68% completed job-readiness training. - 54% placed into paid internships within 90 days. - 72% of placed participants retaine...\n\n## Program Design\n\n1. The program will focus on participant recruitment through targeted outreach in underserved neighborhoods, leveraging existing community networks and partnerships with local schools and community centers (doc_id: evidence.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Organization: BrightSteps Community Network 2024 Impact Snapshot - 1,482 youth served across three districts.'). Employer partnerships will be expanded to include additional sectors such as technology and manufacturing, building on the current 24 employer partners in retail, logistics, and healthcare (doc_id: evidence.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Existing Program Assets - 24 employer partners in retail, logistics, and healthcare support.'). The monthly service model will incorporate regular check-ins, skill-building workshops, and access to a mobile coaching team to address barriers such as limited transportation and low digital literacy (doc_id: evidence.txt, page: 1, snippet: 'Existing Program Assets - Mobile coaching team with bilingual staff.')\n\n### Citations\n- `evidence.txt` p1: Organization: BrightSteps Community Network 2024 Impact Snapshot - 1,482 youth served across three districts. - 68% completed job-readiness training. - 54% placed into paid internships within 90 days. - 72% of placed participants retaine...\n\n## Outcomes and Evaluation\n\n1. The BrightSteps Community Network has demonstrated significant outcomes in its youth employment program. In 2024, the organization served 1,482 youth across three districts, with 68% completing job-readiness training and 54% securing paid internships within 90 days . Furthermore, 72% of those placed into internships retained their employment for at least six months, highlighting the program's effectiveness in fostering long-term job stability .\n2. Despite these achievements, the program faces challenges such as limited transportation access for evening shifts, low digital literacy among first-time job seekers, and a high dropout risk during the first 45 days of placement . To address these barriers, BrightSteps leverages its existing assets, including 24 employer partners, a mobile coaching team with bilingual staff, and a case management system with monthly progress tracking .\n3. Looking ahead, BrightSteps aims to serve 1,700 youth by 2026, building on its current success and addressing identified barriers to enhance program outcomes . The organization's commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation is evident in its planned targets and strategic use of assets.\n\n### Citations\n- `evidence.txt` p1: Organization: BrightSteps Community Network 2024 Impact Snapshot - 1,482 youth served across three districts. - 68% completed job-readiness training. - 54% placed into paid internships within 90 days. - 72% of placed participants retaine...\n\n## Sustainability\n\n_No draft paragraphs available._\n\n### Citations\n- None\n\n### Unsupported / Missing\n- No draft content generated for section 'Sustainability'.
