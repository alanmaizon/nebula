Source of truth: `docs/status.yml` and `docs/wiki/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`

## Execution Snapshot
- Overall completion: `90%`
- Current phase: `Submission Asset Packaging` (`In progress`)

## Delivery Timeline (By Day)
- `2026-02-07`: Backup/restore drill completed with checksum and retrieval recovery evidence (`docs/wiki/Restore-Drill-2026-02-07.md`).
- `2026-02-08`: Deterministic CI reliability gate validated and documented (`docs/wiki/CI-Reliability-2026-02-08.md`).
- `2026-02-11`: Full-workflow demo freeze run passed (`docs/wiki/Demo-Freeze-2026-02-11.md`).

## Current Priorities (Now)
- Produce and publish the 3-minute demo video with `#AmazonNova` and functional footage.
- Prepare public demo/test access instructions and fallback credentials path.

## Next Milestones (Date-Based)
- By `2026-03-16 17:00 PT`:
- Run full clean-environment rehearsals and lock submission build.
- Submit final project (internal target: at least 2 hours earlier).
- Verify repository/demo access and all required links in Devpost.
- By `2026-03-18 17:00 PT`:
- Submit actionable feedback before `2026-03-18 17:00 PT`.
- Keep demo environment stable and reachable through judging period.
- Prepare concise issue-response playbook for judge clarification requests.

## Risk Watch
- Need one credentialed Bedrock runtime evidence run in addition to deterministic/mocked evidence.
- Prevent demo/video drift from deployed behavior near deadline.
- Strengthen measurable impact + innovation narrative against judging criteria.

## Delivery Phases (Step Map)
- Step 0: Governance and Bootstrap
- Step 1: Foundation
- Step 2: Ingestion
- Step 3: Retrieval
- Step 4: Requirements Extraction
- Step 5: Cited Drafting
- Step 6: Coverage
- Step 7: Export and UX
- Step 8: Hardening
- Step 9: Release
- Step 10: Nova Multi-Agent Migration
