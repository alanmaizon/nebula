Determines whether Projects meet a baseline level of viability: the Project must reasonably fit the theme and reasonably apply the required APIs/SDKs.

### Stage Two — Scoring

All Submissions passing Stage One will be evaluated on the following criteria:

| Criterion                          | Weight | Description |

The highest overall scores determine potential prize winners.

### Tie Breaking

### Feedback Submission Criteria

Eligible Feedback Submissions are evaluated on **completeness, viability, and potential impact** of the feedback.

### Blog Post Bonus Prize Criteria

The first 100 eligible blog posts are evaluated on **completeness and potential impact** of submissions covering how the Project can positively affect the target community, including potential benefits, envisioned real-world application, and plans for encouraging adoption.
