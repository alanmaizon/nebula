## Program Design

1. The proposed program is designed to address housing instability among low-income families in East and North Portland neighborhoods. According to the 2025 Impact Report, 62% of enrolled households reported being at risk of eviction within 90 days, highlighting the urgent need for intervention (doc_id: org_impact_report_2025, page: 1, snippet: '62% of enrolled households reported being at risk of eviction within 90 days'). The program will enroll 120 households into coordinated case management, providing weekly navigation sessions and emergency support vouchers to stabilize housing situations (doc_id: program_timeline_attachment_b, page: 1, snippet: 'Enroll 120 households into coordinated case management. Deliver weekly case navigation sessions. Issue transportation and emergency support vouchers').
2. The program's budget is structured to ensure all costs directly support participant services and program delivery, aligning with the funder's guidelines on disallowed costs (doc_id: project_budget_attachment_a, page: 1, snippet: 'All costs directly support participant services and program delivery. No real estate, political activity, or unrelated overhead costs are included'). Key budget items include program staff, participant transportation support, and community partner stipends, totaling $50,000 for the project period (doc_id: project_budget_attachment_a, page: 1, snippet: 'Request amount: $50,000').

## Outcomes and Evaluation

1. The primary outcomes of the housing stability program will be measured through participant retention rates, housing stability metrics, and service utilization data. Specifically, the program aims to achieve a 75% retention rate for enrolled households over a six-month period, as evidenced by previous program cycles where 289 out of 412 households remained stably housed for at least six months after intake . Additionally, the program will track the number of households that transition from being at risk of eviction to achieving stable housing, with a target of reducing the risk of eviction by 50% within the first year of enrollment.
2. Evaluation of the program will be conducted through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative data will be collected through baseline and follow-up assessments at 90-day and 180-day intervals, measuring changes in housing stability, employment status, and access to essential services. Qualitative data will be gathered through participant interviews and focus groups to capture personal experiences and feedback on the program's impact. This mixed-methods approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of the program's effectiveness and areas for improvement.
