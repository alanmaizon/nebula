# Draft for Portland Community Resilience 2026 Demo

## Need Statement

1. In 2025, 62% of enrolled households reported being at risk of eviction within 90 days, highlighting a critical need for housing stability services in East and North Portland neighborhoods (doc_id: org_impact_report_2025, page: 1, snippet: 'In 2025, 62% of enrolled households reported being at risk of eviction within 90 days.'). This alarming statistic underscores the urgency for targeted interventions to prevent homelessness and support families in maintaining stable housing.
2. The population most affected by housing instability includes low-income families, with 71% of participating households having at least one child under age 18 (doc_id: org_impact_report_2025, page: 1, snippet: '71% of participating households had at least one child under age 18.'). This demographic is particularly vulnerable, as housing insecurity can lead to adverse outcomes for children, including poor academic performance and increased stress levels.
3. Transportation barriers exacerbate the challenges faced by families in maintaining housing stability, with 68% of client households identifying transportation as a reason for missed appointments (doc_id: org_impact_report_2025, page: 1, snippet: '68% of client households identified transportation barriers as a reason for missed appointments.'). Addressing these barriers is essential for ensuring consistent access to services and support.

## Outcomes and Evaluation

1. The primary outcomes of the housing stability program will be measured through participant retention, housing stability, and service access improvements. Specifically, the program aims to achieve a 75% retention rate for enrolled households, ensuring that families remain engaged in the program and receive consistent support. Additionally, the program targets a 60% increase in housing stability, defined as households remaining in their current residence for at least six months post-enrollment. This goal is grounded in the organization's 2025 impact report, which showed a 46% retention rate and a 50% increase in housing stability among participants .
2. Evaluation of the program will be conducted through a mixed-methods approach, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data will be collected through baseline and follow-up assessments at 90 and 180 days post-enrollment, measuring changes in housing stability, employment status, and access to essential services. Qualitative data will be gathered through participant interviews and focus groups, providing deeper insights into the program's impact on families' lives. This comprehensive evaluation strategy ensures a robust understanding of the program's effectiveness, as recommended by the City of Portland's Community Resilience Microgrant guidelines .
3. The program's success will also be evaluated through community partner feedback and collaboration metrics. Regular interdisciplinary case review meetings will be held to monitor participant progress and adjust service delivery as needed. Additionally, community partner stipends will be provided to incentivize ongoing collaboration and support, as detailed in the project budget . This approach ensures that the program remains responsive to the needs of both participants and community stakeholders.
